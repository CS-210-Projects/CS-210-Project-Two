# CS-210-Project-Two Airgead Banking

# Project Summary
The Airgead Banking project involved developing an application that helps users understand the growth of their investments over time through the power of compound interest. The application was designed to meet the needs of Airgead Banking as they partner with a local high school to educate students on fiscal responsibility. The program allows users to input their initial investment amount, monthly deposits, interest rate, and investment duration, and then displays a detailed report of their year-end balances with and without additional monthly deposits.

# What I Did Well
I excelled in creating a user-friendly interface that clearly displays the required information and prompts users for their input. The modular design of the code made it easy to manage different aspects of the investment calculations, ensuring that each part of the program was focused and efficient.

# Areas for Enhancement
While the program functions as required, I could enhance the code by improving the input validation process. By adding more robust error handling, the program would become more resilient to incorrect user input, ensuring that only valid data is processed. This would make the application more secure and reduce the likelihood of crashes or unexpected behavior.

# Challenges and Solutions
One of the more challenging aspects of this project was accurately calculating compound interest over multiple years, especially when including monthly deposits. To overcome this, I carefully broke down the formula into manageable steps and used a loop structure to ensure that the calculations were applied correctly for each month and year. Online resources and thorough testing were crucial in ensuring the accuracy of these calculations.

# Transferable Skills
The skills I developed in modular programming, user input handling, and financial calculations are highly transferable to other projects. Whether itâ€™s creating financial applications or handling user input in a different context, these skills will serve me well in future coding endeavors.

# Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability
To ensure that the program is maintainable and adaptable, I followed best practices for naming conventions and included inline comments throughout the code. This not only makes the code easier to understand and modify but also ensures that it can be easily extended or adapted for future needs, such as incorporating additional financial products or features.
